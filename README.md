# hip-hop-hero

This program is a text-based simulation game of a
rapper. The rapper has attributes such as money,
hitpoints, reputation, and microphone skills. These
attributes can be increased by simulated events such
as selling mixtapes, making music videos, using the 
jacuzzi, or rap battling other rappers. The goal of the
game is to accrue as much reputation, microphone skills,
and money as possible. This game was loosely inspired
by games such as Pokemon and Oregon Trail.
